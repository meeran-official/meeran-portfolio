          <p>
            With four years of experience as a Product Engineer, I specialize in developing and maintaining backend systems for complex supply chain management applications. What truly drives me is going beyond the immediate taskâ€”pioneering new tools like Git and AI at my organization, mentoring my team through detailed documentation, and exploring new frameworks like Flutter to understand the complete software lifecycle. I am now seeking a challenging role where I can apply my deep Java expertise and my passion for building intelligent, high-impact systems.
