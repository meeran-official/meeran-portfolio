## üöÄ About This Project

This portfolio was built as a personal project to not only showcase my work but also to gain hands-on experience with modern frontend development using **React** and its ecosystem. The goal was to create a clean, professional, and aesthetically pleasing single-page application that tells my professional story in an engaging way.

It moves beyond a static page by integrating live data from the GitHub API and using a modern animation library to create a fluid user experience.
